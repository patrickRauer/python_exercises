# Python exercises
**Python exercises** are a couple of exercises to practice python in different situations.
Starting from the very basics to more advanced python OOP parts as well as
working with ex. the web-framework **django**.

Most of the exercises should be self explaining and should be doable for an advanced beginner or higher (google will help, if needed)


## Tips
Do not use ChatGPT and co to solve the exercises. They are ment to be solvable by every programmer and
most of them can be solved on a piece of paper. Here the motto is less tools are better choice.


## Collaboration
I wrote these exercises because I regularly spotted the underlying issues, if I look over the work of Junior devs.
If there are any other exercises, which should be included, please create an issue or submit a PR. 
Also, if someone spots an issue, please create an issue. No one is perfect.
